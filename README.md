This is a web scraping project done in  R .
Goal : To extract the charity details from the website , such as the name and details of the charity (website , email , contact_number) 
and the cause area related to the charity , such as environment , animals , children , women development etc .
Challenges: Parsing the information so as to find out and extract the relevant details . Sometimes , if there is not standardization
in writing the html page, like the telephone numbers , then indentifying them in the blob of text becomes a recursive task for the 
programmer . Also since a list is returned when we use the 'rvest' package function to read the html text , should be well versed in using them to retrieve their contents . Also ,should be good at reading and searching strings for patterns .
